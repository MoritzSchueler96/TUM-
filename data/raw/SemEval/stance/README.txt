************************************************
File Format
************************************************

Tha annotation file has the following format:
<Worker ID>,<Instance ID>,<Target>,<Tweet>,<Stance>,<Opinion towards>

where

<Worker ID> is an ID for a crowd worker; to preserve privacy, we replaced the CrowdFlower worker IDs with sequential IDs, but kept the same ID for all annotations performed by a particular worker;

<Instance ID> is an ID for an annotated tweet; the IDs are the same that were used in the SemEval-2016 Task 6 training and test datasets; instances without an ID were not used in the shared task (inter-annotator agreement on these instances is less than 60%);

<Target> is the entity of interest; there are 5 possible targets: "Atheism", "Donald Trump", "Feminist Movement", "Hillary Clinton", and "Legalization of Abortion";

<Tweet> is a tweet text;

<Stance> is a worker's answer to the following question: 'From reading the tweet, which of the options below is most likely to be true about the tweeter’s stance or outlook towards the target' 

The possible answers are:
FAVOR: We can infer from the tweet that the tweeter supports the target (e.g., directly or indirectly by supporting someone/something, by opposing or criticizing someone/something opposed to the target, or by echoing the stance of somebody else)
AGAINST: We can infer from the tweet that the tweeter is against the target (e.g., directly or indirectly by opposing or criticizing someone/something, by supporting someone/something opposed to the target, or by echoing the stance of somebody else)
NEUTRAL: We can infer from the tweet that the tweeter has a neutral stance towards the target (e.g., the tweeter supports the target entity to some extent, but is also against it to some extent)
NONE: none of the above.

<Opinion towards> is a worker's answer to the following question: 'From reading the tweet, which of the options below is most likely to be true about the focus of opinion/sentiment in the tweet' 

The possible answers are:
TARGET: The tweet explicitly expresses opinion about the target, a part of the target, or an aspect of the target
OTHER: The tweet does NOT expresses opinion about the target but it HAS opinion about something or someone other than the target
NO ONE: The tweet is not explicitly expressing opinion. (For example, the tweet is simply giving information.)


(Note: for the target 'Climate Change is a Real Concern', tweets were annotated internally and are not included in this file.)
