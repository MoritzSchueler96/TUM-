Whether it was working with Marian Wright Edelman to lift children out of poverty, fighting to repair the damage of housing discrimination with the Fair Housing Act, or persistently pushing us to protect precious places like the St. Croix River and our beloved Boundary Waters, he charted an unwavering path. He was also a true friend, full of lively questions, incisive and hysterically funny commentary, advice offered with his unique dry wit, birthdays remembered and lunches shared, preferably with onion rings. He deeply loved all his family with the best gift a father can give, unconditional love, expressed with classic Mondale understatement: “Keep up the good work.” I am bereft and so grateful to have known him.

At this moment, my thoughts are with the Floyd family and this personal moment of justice, as well as with every family of color that has watched video after video and pictured their child or family member as the next victim of excessive force or profiling. This deadly cycle cannot keep repeating itself. As a nation, we simply must do more to ensure that the basic human rights of Americans are protected at all times, even if they are suspected of a crime. We also must fundamentally reform our thinking and systems so that individuals are not assumed suspects because of the color of their skin or the clothes they wear. It’s morally wrong and a waste of legitimate police resources. No matter how this trial ended, the Senate has a duty to take up and pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that was approved by the House of Representatives last month. This comprehensive package includes bills that I authored, including the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act, which would prohibit the use of racial and religious profiling by police, and the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act that can begin to change the tactics used and the tenor of interactions between law enforcement and American communities, especially those of color. We need to make a change now. https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/20/us/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/20/us/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd,,,Derek Chauvin Trial Live Updates: Chauvin Found Guilty of Murdering George Floyd,"Mr. Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Beyond the sparse audience owing to social distance requirements, there was a sense of relief that America was getting back on track. We were transported to a time when the president of the United States wanted to talk to the whole country about the policies that will make life better for all. President Biden’s optimism for our country was front and center, along with his desire to work with Congress to do right by the American people, especially those who have been systemically cut off from basic rights and opportunities. It was striking to hear the herculean steps that have been taken over the last 100 days to pull our nation out of the COVID-19 global health crisis. Nearly 40 percent of adults in this country have been fully vaccinated. The federal government also has injected immense resources through the American Rescue Plan at all levels of government to help those individuals, families and small businesses most harmed by the pandemic, including the economic and social damage left in its wake. President Biden was clear that there is much work to be done – ‘we can’t let our guard down, he said’ – but that America can meet every challenge, if we work together and support each other. We will continue to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control. We also will have a generational opportunity to tackle so many of the systemic issues that have held back Americans from success. I stand ready to help formulate a bipartisan plan to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure that creates jobs and respects our environment. We will continue to help our small businesses, a growth engine of our economy, with support and resources so they can survive and innovate well beyond the pandemic. We need to value the people who make our country work, ensuring that no one who has a full-time job lives in poverty, wants for stable housing or wonders when they will get their next meal. Women should no longer be forced to make decisions on whether to stay home or reenter the workforce due to the high cost of child care. Education stretching from Pre-K to college is essential and must be affordable. Quality health care and paid family leave are essential and must be a right for everyone in this country, not only those with greater means. In addition to supporting American families, Congress should also take up the president’s challenge to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Compassion is an American value that has been missing in our immigration system for far too long. We also should work together to finally address the pandemic of gun violence that claims too many victims daily, along with reforms to our justice system that would hold police accountable and rebuild trust with communities who have seen too many young men and women struck down without justification. As a nation, we simply must do more to ensure that the basic human rights of Americans are protected at all times. Joe Biden has only been president for 99 days. His record of accomplishment and his ability to work with Congress has been remarkable. There will be policy differences ahead, but I urge all my colleagues to set partisanship aside and work together for the good of our nation. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/28/biden-address-congress-live-updates/",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/28/biden-address-congress-live-updates/,,,Live updates: Biden pitches his ambitious investment and tax plans as he recasts role of government,Biden’s address in the House chamber will look very different from past presidential speeches because of pandemic restrictions.

Every day, we’ll lift up a new #CancelStudentDebt Champion, but today we’re going to start with three true leaders in this movement: Senator Chuck Schumer, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley” 

Senator Chuck Schumer has become one of the fiercest advocates of student debt cancellation, using his platform to lift up millions of student loan borrowers in New York and across the country. We’re thrilled to recognize him as a #CancelStudentDebt Champion!

The movement to #CancelStudentDebt would not be where it is today without Senator Warren. She popularized the idea while passionately making the case that it will benefit the whole economy and narrow the racial wealth gap—she’s no doubt a #CancelStudentDebt Champion!

 Congresswoman Pressley, the lead House #CancelStudentDebt Champion says “if President Biden is serious about closing the racial wealth gap, if President Biden seeks to build back better, then he must use his executive authority to issue broad-based, across-the-board student debt cancellation.” We couldn’t agree more!",,,1.0,3553,5172.55223880597,0.6868949477869697
